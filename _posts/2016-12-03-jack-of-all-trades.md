So there is this saying --- "[Jack of all trades, master of none][wiki-jacktrades]".

And there is that humorous [image][knifeimage] of an extended swiss army knife
pop up in my head from time to time. Apparently, there are unsurprisingly also
[real products][wenger] out there. Unsurprising this do not surprise me.

And then there are those articles, blog posts and "news" about _just how long_
it would take the average person to really excel at some skill. And I think
about all the things I know and all my skills, in electronics and programming.

I instinctively dislike the thought of being a kind of _generalist_ -- I've
always set out to be a _specialist_ in whatever endeavour I'd be currently
pursuing. This is never a conscious decision, it is my hardwired behaviour to
explore things and really dig deep when something interests me. I just can't
help it. And there is no way I'm going to carry something like a swiss army
knife or a "leatherman" with me -- I'd rather take my chances with the one
pozidriv screwdriver..

However, modern programming practices requires a whole bunch of knowledge
spanning a very wide range of disciplines. So even if one would strive to
restrict the scope of research and focus on this one thing, whatever it might
be; there just might be a lower limit to how focused that scope can be without
compromising the overall skillset.  This one thing requires a database and the
database must be secured and the server must be logged in to and encryption
keys and networking and..

It snowballs very quickly and that small scope is all of a sudden all-encompassing. 

I imagine this "problem" has grown very fast the last couple tens of years,
with the [devops][agile-admin-devops] style of joint system administration and
development gaining popularity as a countermeasure..

At the same time, an ability to design some smart appliance using only discrete
`CD4000` logic chips translates somewhat and is indeed useful if one was to
solve the same problem using a microcontroller.
.. The project I'm thinking of was a cat smart home with motion sensors and
ambient light sensors, probably should post it somewhere.

The huge amount of things a contemporary programmer _probably should know
about_ just seems astounding at times. That is all.
