This post marks the start of this here blog, created as part of an assignment
in the course ["1DV022 -- Client-based Web Programming"][1dv022] at Linnaeus
University in Kalmar.

The blog is built with the static site generator [`Jekyll`][jekyll], which
basically allows authoring the content in simple text-files. The site is built
into static `html`-pages by `Jekyll`, where1 separate configuration files and
stylesheets determine how the content is presented and organized.

Most assignments and projects suitable for public display will be uploaded to
this blog, as well as other miscellaneous "personal" posts.

I've been wanting to create a Jekyll-based personal blog for a couple of years
-- funny how most workflows, toolchains and techniques we've used during the
[Software Development and Operations programme][udm] has lined up almost
perfectly with my private interests and workflows.

More about [Markdown][markdown] and the so-called "plain-text" approach to
writing in future posts .. _(More about workflows too I bet)_
