Present
-------
I am currently studying [Software Development and Operations][udm-devops] 
at [Linnaeus University][lnu-eng] full-time.

I am also employed as a _Fixare_ at [Hemfixare][hemfixare], a new 
startup that provides technical support to households, covering common 
household electronics. 

Past
----
I have some background in electronics engineering; been a hobbyist on
and off since I was a little kids and also have some formal education.

When I was about `0x0A` (10<sub>10</sub>) years old, I installed games 
that I had created on the class computer in school for everyone to play. 
I have been interested in various kinds of programming for as long as I 
can remember.

Future
