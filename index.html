            <h2 id="present">Present</h2>
            <p>I am currently studying
                <a href="http://udm-devops.se">Software Development and Operations</a>
                at <a href="https://lnu.se/en/">Linnaeus University</a> full-time.</p>
            <p>I am also employed as a <em>fixare</em> at <a href="https://hemfixare.se/">Hemfixare</a>,
               a startup that provides technical support to households.</p>

            <h2 id="past">Past</h2>
            <p>I have some background in electronics engineering --- I've been a
                hobbyist on and off since I was a little kid. I also have some formal
                education and <em>a lot</em> of practical experience in analog circuit design.
            </p>
            <p>When I was about <code>0x0A</code> (10<sub>10</sub>) years old,
                I installed games that I had created on the class computer in
                school for everyone to play. I have been interested in various
                kinds of programming for as long as I can remember.</p>

            <h2 id="future">Future</h2>
            <p>I would like to work with software development or
                electrical engineering --- preferably "close to the metal".
                I'd really like to do UNIX system administration
                and embedded systems development. </p>
