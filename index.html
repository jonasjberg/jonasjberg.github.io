    <p>I have some background in electronics engineering; been a hobbyist on
        and off since I was a little kids and also have some formal education.</p>

    <p>When I was about <code>0x0A</code> (10<sub>10</sub>) years old, I
       installed games that I had created on the class computer in school for

       for as long as I can remember.</p>
