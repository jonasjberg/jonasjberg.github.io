            <h2 id="present">Present</h2>
            <p>I am currently studying
               <a href="http://udm-devops.se">Software Development and Operations</a>
               at <a href="https://lnu.se/en/">Linnaeus University</a> full-time.</p>
            <p>I am also employed as a <em>fixare</em> at
               <a href="https://hemfixare.se/">Hemfixare</a>, a startup that
                provides technical support to households.</p>

            <h2 id="past">Past</h2>
            <p>I have some background in electronics engineering &mdash; I've been
               a hobbyist on and off since I was a little kid. I also have some
               formal education and <em>a lot</em> of practical experience in
               analog circuit design.
            </p>
            <p>When I was about <code>0x0A</code> years old, I installed games
               that I had created on the class computer in school for everyone
               to play. I have been interested in various kinds of programming
               for as long as I can remember.</p>

            <h2 id="future">Future</h2>
            <p>I would like to work with <strong>software development</strong> or
                <strong>electrical engineering</strong> &mdash; preferably "close to
                the metal". I'd really like to do UNIX system administration
                and embedded systems development. Alternatively, I'd like to do
                analog circuit design or something else in the realm of
                electrical engineering.
                What really captivates me is <strong>problem solving</strong> and being
                part of a <strong>creative process</strong>.
