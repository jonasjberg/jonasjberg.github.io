    <p>I am currently studying <a href="http://udm-devops.se" target="_blank">Software
        Development and Operations</a> at
        <a href="https://lnu.se/en/" target="_blank">Linnaeus University</a> full-time. </p>

    <h2>Past</h2>
    <p>I have some background in electronics engineering; been a hobbyist on
        and off since I was a little kids and also have some formal
        education.</p>

    <p>When I was about <code>0x0A</code> (10<sub>10</sub>) years old, I
        installed games that I had created on the class computer in school for
        everyone to play. I have been interested in various kinds of programming
        for as long as I can remember.</p>
